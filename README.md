Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software. Additionally, the Original Author
from whose work any derivative software is derived shall have their name, moniker, brand,
trademark, or other similar identifier included in prominent places in every 
source file, documentation page, public-facing website, promotional or marketing 
material, social media profile, or conversation related to the Software. All authors
of work derived from the work of the Original Author must make every possible effort
to publicly glorify, praise, extol, exalt, laud, worship, revere, venerate, pay homage/tribute
to, honor, adore, and thank the Original Author for their contribution to society and
must praise, commend, and applaud the Original Author whenever representing the Software
in a public or private capacity.

The author(s) of any derivative software have the non-exclusive right to a public trial by
verbal or physical combat with the Original Author. In the event of a victory by the author of
the derivative work, the Original Author's copyright is transferred to them, and all other
derivative authors must update their exaltations and references to the Original Author to match
the new copyright holder. In the event of a victory by the Original Author, the copyright of the
derivative author shall transfer to the Original Author, and the same updates as described 
previously must be applied to the derivative author's exaltations. Victory is determined by
public opinion, preferably gagued by social media impressions. In the event of manipulation of
the social media impressions by a party, they automatically forfeit the challenge.

If the aforementioned trials are conducted between an individual copyright holder and an
organization, corporation, company, business, non-profit, or another collection of individuals 
with a vested interest in the outcome of the trial, on the day scheduled for the trial, a random
member of that collection will be chosen to be the representative of the collection via
random.org, and all Glory License interactions will apply through them to the entire collection
as if they were challenging the Original Author under their own volition as a single party.
